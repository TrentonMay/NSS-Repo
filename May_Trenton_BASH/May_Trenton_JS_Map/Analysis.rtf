\f0\fs24 \cf0 Upon looking at the map it would appear that there is a heavy concentration of IP\'92s coming from America, Europe, and some more in China (but not as much as Europe and the US). There are some more scattered across the globe but the concentrations are in these places. Also, contrary to what I would have thought not many of the errors are coming from china but more are in Europe after I checked some of the IP\'92s in the access logs and checked their status codes. One of the most odd locations with tons of errors was a IP coming from Panama, 186.74.162.75. This IP made 12 consecutive requests to the server and each request returned a \'91400\'92 class error. Another from Brazil (the only one in brazil) made 25 requests with the same result as the one from Panama, all \'91400\'92 class errors. The trend here seems to be that the bulk of the errors come from clients that repeatedly have errors and are well isolated on the map with hardly any other users around them.}
